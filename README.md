# escapemachine
A python script for supporting Escape Room puzzles with a Raspberry Pi (https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

# Features
The Pi runs the following functions:
- Allow the game master to play spoken hints and sound effects, from a previously placed set of sound files
- Play the background music for the escape room, with fading over to other tracks on scene changes
- Follow scene progression from a phone, allow for direct intervention by enabling or disabling individual relays
- Show a countdown timer and log scene changes

# Interface 
The interface was built using materializecss and is aimed at phone and tablet use. 

# Technically..
..this script was converted from Mark Ottings orginal version which ran on a C.H.I.P.
